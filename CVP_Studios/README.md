# CVP_Studios

These Studios provide some simple examples of operational tasks that can be performed in CVP using the scripting capabilities provided by the CV Studios.

**Vaiable_Discovery**

This Studio provides an overview of the different types of Studio context variables available. A device tag is required to produce the device specific data. To use the Studio import the zip into CVP in the "Studios" page, then open the newly imported Studio in a workspace.


**SimpleServiceInterface**

This Studio demonstrates the creation of VLAN trunk interfaces with predefined configuration based on which services are created in the Interface Profile section. Each service is provided on a different VLAN in this example. The VLANs can be applied to an interface by selecting a device, then selecting an interface, and applying the required services to it.
